The folder 'DL Pipeline for 3D Muscle Segmentation' consists of two subfolders:
- 'Pipeline development' was created for optimising the DL models for three segmentation tasks separately
- 'Final app' puts together the three models and additional computation modules to form the image processing pipeline
- 'MRI dataset' folder with the MR images and gorund truth segmentations which served as base to develop the pipeline (will be released once the underlying work is published)
